## My process
firstly i had created the desktop design and take help from the internet for making gradient color and finally i had create the mobile design by using media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had learned how to arrange a svg images in a document accordingly and Know how to make a beautiful single landing page very nicely and i have to work hard for moving one step further but i have faced one problem in making round border around facebook icon except other two icons borders were created very easily. 

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on fixed width of an div while using flexbox in future projects. i have learn some further in responsive websites and i have to work more on that. I have to learn other techniques which found useful for me to refine and perfect and in this challenge i had made the phone design without any problem, that is my plus point during the creation of mobile design using media query.
